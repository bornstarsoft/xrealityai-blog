Kojima Productions has taken a bold step into the gaming hardware market with the announcement of its first-ever gaming tablet, the ROG Flow Z13-KJP, developed in collaboration with ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG). This innovative 2-in-1 device is not just a tablet; it embodies the artistic vision of renowned designer Yoji Shinkawa, who has infused the design with elements inspired by the studio's iconic Ludens mascot.

The ROG Flow Z13-KJP boasts impressive specifications, including a stunning 13.4-inch 2.5K display with a 180Hz refresh rate and powered by an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor. The inclusion of a custom Death Stranding-style carry case designed by Shinkawa adds a unique touch, making this tablet not only a powerful gaming device but also a collector's item for fans.

Alongside the tablet, ASUS is set to release a range of themed accessories, including a gaming headset and mouse, further enhancing the gaming experience. While pricing and release dates remain under wraps, the anticipation surrounding these products suggests a promising future for Kojima Productions in the hardware space. Will this collaboration redefine gaming tablets as we know them?
