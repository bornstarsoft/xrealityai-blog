In a groundbreaking move, the Delhi Police are set to utilize AI-enabled smart spectacles for enhanced security during the Republic Day celebrations. These innovative devices, equipped with facial recognition and thermal imaging technology, promise to transform how law enforcement monitors and responds to potential threats in real-time.

The smart spectacles, provided by Indian company AjnaLens, will be distributed to officers at key locations, including the Kartavya Path. By linking these devices to the police database, officers can instantly access vital information about individuals they encounter, significantly improving the efficiency of security operations. The spectacles will visually categorize individuals, marking them in green for no criminal involvement and red for those with a criminal record, thereby streamlining the identification process.

Moreover, the integration of thermal imaging technology will allow officers to detect concealed weapons or suspicious objects that may not be visible to the naked eye. This multi-layered approach, combined with enhanced CCTV surveillance and drone monitoring, underscores a significant leap in public safety measures. As technology continues to evolve, one can't help but wonder how such advancements will shape the future of urban security.
