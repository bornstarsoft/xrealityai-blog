The NP Extended Reality (XR) Stage in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, is revolutionizing the event industry by merging XR technology with artificial intelligence (AI). This innovative approach allows for immersive experiences that were once only possible in physical settings. During my visit, I was amazed by how the XR stage seamlessly blended LED spatial images with real-time visuals, creating an otherworldly experience that transported me to outer space.

Founded in 2006, NP has evolved from an event agency to a leader in XR technology, gaining recognition for its role in high-profile events like the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Co-CEOs Baek Seung-up and Choi Ji-hoon are committed to pushing the boundaries of what events can achieve, emphasizing that XR is not just a trend but a universal technology applicable across various industries, including healthcare and manufacturing.

As we look to the future, the integration of AI in video production for XR experiences promises to enhance creativity and efficiency. NP aims to secure its expertise in the event sector while eyeing global expansion. How will the fusion of XR and AI reshape the way we experience events in the coming years?
