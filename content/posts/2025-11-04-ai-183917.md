Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, has captured global attention with the upcoming 2025 APEC Summit, yet it faces significant challenges in transforming into a premier global tourist destination. Experts emphasize the urgent need for improved tourism infrastructure, including the attraction of foreign-only casinos and luxury hotels, to leverage its rich historical and cultural resources. The city's potential as an international conference hub is evident, but without strategic enhancements, it risks falling short of expectations.

The recent APEC Summit highlighted Gyeongju's limitations, particularly in accommodation and transportation. With only two five-star hotels available, many high-profile attendees were forced to seek lodging in nearby cities, underscoring the necessity for more upscale options. Furthermore, calls for improved transport links to major attractions like the Gyeongju Bomun Complex and Bulguksa Temple are growing, with proposals for trams or monorails gaining traction. As Gyeongju looks to the future, the integration of digital experiences and cultural heritage tourism will be crucial in attracting a diverse range of visitors.

As Gyeongju embarks on this transformative journey, the question remains: will it seize the opportunity to redefine its tourism landscape and emerge as a global player in the travel industry?
