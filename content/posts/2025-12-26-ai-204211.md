The Qualcomm Make in Africa Startup Mentorship Program 2026 is a game-changer for early-stage tech startups across the continent. With a focus on equity-free support, this initiative offers African innovators access to invaluable resources, including expert mentorship, technical training, and a stipend of $5,000. This program aims to bridge the gap in Africa's burgeoning deep-tech ecosystem, particularly in areas like AI, IoT, and extended reality, where many startups often struggle to find the necessary support to scale their solutions.

Participants in the program will benefit from one-on-one mentorship with Qualcomm experts, gaining insights that can significantly enhance their product development and business strategies. Additionally, the program includes masterclasses on critical topics such as intellectual property strategy and pitching to investors, ensuring that startups are well-equipped to navigate the complexities of the tech landscape. As the deadline for applications approaches on February 15, 2026, this is an excellent opportunity for startups looking to make a mark in the tech industry.

With the right support, African startups can transform their innovative ideas into impactful solutions. Will you be one of the next success stories emerging from this mentorship program?
