Maharashtra's recent approval of the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR) Policy 2025 marks a significant milestone in the state's ambition to become a global hub for digital creativity and innovation. With a staggering investment of Rs 50,000 crore expected over the next two decades, this policy aims to create nearly 2 lakh high-tech jobs, positioning Mumbai as the epicenter of India's entertainment and tourism industries.

The policy not only recognizes AVGC-XR as a vital industry but also as a crucial infrastructure sector, paving the way for dedicated AVGC-XR parks equipped with cutting-edge facilities. This initiative will foster a thriving ecosystem for startups and established companies alike, ensuring Maharashtra remains at the forefront of technological advancements in various sectors, including healthcare, education, and agriculture.

As we look ahead, the establishment of these AVGC-XR hubs could redefine the landscape of digital creativity in India. Will Maharashtra's ambitious plans inspire similar initiatives across the country? Only time will tell.
