The integration of XR wearables and AI twins represents a forward-thinking approach that not only aims to boost local manufacturing but also positions Taiwan as a leader in the next wave of technological advancements. As these technologies evolve, they may pave the way for new applications and opportunities within the panel sector. Will Taiwan's gamble on these innovations pay off in the long run, or will it face further challenges from global competitors?
