As CES 2026 approaches, the spotlight is shifting towards entertech, a fusion of entertainment and technology that is set to redefine the landscape of K-content. This years event in Las Vegas promises to showcase how artificial intelligence (AI) and extended reality (XR) are not just trends but integral components of the entertainment industrys evolution.

The Next K-Wave Entertech Forum, happening alongside CES, will delve into the convergence of these technologies with K-content, featuring thought leaders like Professor Koh Sam-seok and CTO Del Parks. Their insights will highlight the necessity for the Korean Wave to evolve into a co-evolution model, where technology and content grow symbiotically, ensuring global competitiveness.

As we gear up for CES 2026, the question remains: How will the integration of AI and XR shape the future of entertainment, and what strategies will emerge from this pivotal moment in K-content?
