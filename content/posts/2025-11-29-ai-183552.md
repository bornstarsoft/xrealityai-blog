Experts at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M) have identified Extended Reality (XR) as the next major technological surge following Artificial Intelligence (AI). This encompasses virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), all of which are set to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, education, and entertainment.

The advancements in XR technologies have made them increasingly accessible and affordable, paving the way for mainstream adoption. From immersive gaming experiences to virtual training simulations for professionals, the potential applications are vast and varied. The symposium underscored the importance of investing in research and development to fully unlock XR's capabilities, emphasizing collaboration across academia, industry, and government.

As we stand on the brink of this technological breakthrough, the question remains: how will XR reshape our daily lives and the industries we rely on? The future looks bright for XR, and its an exciting time to be part of this evolution.
