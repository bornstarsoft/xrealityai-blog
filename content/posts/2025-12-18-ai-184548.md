Naver is making waves in the global extended reality (XR) content market by transitioning from a platform operator to a content producer. With the establishment of its first overseas production base in Vietnam, Naver is poised to leverage artificial intelligence to create immersive experiences that redefine user interaction. This strategic shift marks a significant evolution in how the company plans to compete in the burgeoning XR landscape.

The newly launched Vietnam Visual Experience (VVE) studio in Ho Chi Minh City will focus on producing adaptive XR content, including virtual artists and interactive environments that respond to user behavior. By harnessing Vietnam's rich talent pool in AI and graphics, Naver aims to scale its production capabilities for a global audience, positioning itself as a key player in the next computing platform that XR represents.

As the XR market is projected to grow exponentially, Naver's proactive approach to content creation rather than mere distribution could be a game-changer. Will this strategy enable Naver to secure a leading role in the future of immersive media, or will the competition prove too fierce? Only time will tell.
