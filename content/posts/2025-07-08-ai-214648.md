The landscape of business education is rapidly transforming due to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and extended reality (XR). As these technologies reshape industries, the skills required for future leaders are evolving at an unprecedented pace. To remain relevant, educational institutions must rethink their curricula and teaching methodologies, moving away from traditional methods that no longer suffice in preparing students for an AI-driven world.

In this new era, analytical thinking, adaptability, collaboration with AI, and ethical considerations are essential skills for tomorrow's leaders. Graduates must not only understand foundational business concepts but also be equipped to navigate the complexities of AI and its implications. Embracing experiential learning environments powered by XR and AI is no longer optional; it is crucial for fostering effective and impactful business education.

As we look to the future, the question remains: how will educational institutions adapt to ensure that their graduates are not just participants in the workforce, but innovators who can thrive in a technology-driven landscape?
