In a groundbreaking workshop held at MSU-IIT, educators explored the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (ER) in collaborative teaching. With 75 participants from various educational institutions, the event highlighted how integrating these technologies can enhance teaching strategies and engage learners in unprecedented ways.

The workshop featured a compelling lecture by Prof. Naoki Suzuki from Tokyo Gakugei University, who shared real-world examples of successful AI and VR implementations in classrooms. Participants had the unique opportunity to experience VR headsets and AI-powered tools firsthand, immersing themselves in virtual learning environments that could redefine their teaching methodologies.

As Dr. Harlyn Mae S. Ompoc noted, experiencing these technologies firsthand opened new possibilities for educators. This initiative not only reflects MSU-IIT's commitment to innovative education but also sets the stage for future-ready classrooms. How will you leverage AI and ER in your teaching practices?
