ASUS is making a bold move by stepping away from its smartphone lines, including the Zenfone and ROG Phone, to focus on artificial intelligence-driven products. This strategic pivot, as reported by Inside, highlights the company's commitment to investing in commercial PCs and innovative AI technologies such as robotics and AI glasses. Jonney Shih, the chairman of ASUS, emphasized that the future of computing lies in these advanced technologies rather than traditional mobile devices.

This shift signals a significant change in the tech landscape, as companies like ASUS recognize the growing importance of AI in everyday life. By reallocating resources towards AI development, ASUS aims to position itself at the forefront of the next computing revolution. Will this trend inspire other tech giants to follow suit, or will the smartphone market continue to thrive despite these changes?
