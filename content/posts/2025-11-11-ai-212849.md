The Netflix animation 'KPop Demon Hunters' offers a profound exploration of philosophy, particularly through the lens of the Buddhist concept of the Non-dual Middle Way. This concept is embodied in the journey of Rumi, a protagonist who grapples with her identity as both a hunter and a being with demon blood. Her acceptance of this duality serves as a powerful metaphor for embracing the complexities of our own identities in a rapidly evolving world.

Venerable Misan, director of the KAIST Center for Contemplative Science, highlights the importance of such philosophical narratives, especially in an age dominated by artificial intelligence and geopolitical tensions. He argues that understanding the interconnectedness of personal healing and social integration is crucial, especially as we navigate the challenges posed by technological monopolies.

As we reflect on Rumi's journey, we are reminded that our struggles and identities are not separate; they are intertwined. In a world where division often reigns, how can we embrace our complexities and foster solidarity?
