In a groundbreaking initiative, the Institute of Genomics and Global Health (IGH) at Redeemers University has hosted Africa's first-ever AI and Extended Reality (XR) Genomics Hackathon. This event marks a significant leap forward in how genomics is taught and experienced, merging cutting-edge technology with scientific inquiry. With over 150 international participants collaborating remotely, the hackathon aims to create immersive simulations of genomic laboratory processes, making complex genetic data more accessible to young scientists.

The on-site phase of the hackathon brought together twenty talented scientists from Nigeria, with additional participants from Kenya and Uganda joining remotely. Professor Christian Happi, the director of IGH, emphasized the importance of integrating XR and AI technologies into genomics education. This innovative approach not only enhances learning but also prepares the next generation of scientists to tackle complex challenges in the field.

As the event culminates in a public Demo Day on August 22, 2025, where finalists will showcase their projects, it serves as a testament to the potential of African innovation in scientific education. Will this pioneering event inspire similar initiatives across the continent and beyond?
