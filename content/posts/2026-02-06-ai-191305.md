In January 2026, Qualcomm launched its "Make in Africa" initiative, a groundbreaking program aimed at nurturing early-stage startups across the continent. This initiative is particularly noteworthy because it offers equity-free mentorship, allowing entrepreneurs to retain full ownership of their businesses while gaining invaluable access to Qualcomm's expertise in advanced technologies like 5G, AI, and IoT.

The program is designed to support ten selected startups through a comprehensive mentorship cycle, providing them with technical training, business coaching, and guidance on intellectual property protection. This approach not only fosters innovation but also positions African startups to compete on a global scale, reinforcing Qualcomm's commitment to accelerating digital development in Africa.

As the application deadline approaches on February 15, 2026, this initiative presents a unique opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs to elevate their ventures. Will we see a new wave of groundbreaking solutions emerging from Africa as a result of this mentorship program?
