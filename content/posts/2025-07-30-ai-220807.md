On July 29, 2025, BSNL Visakhapatnam took a significant step towards embracing Industry 4.0 by signing eight Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with various startups and incubators under its Kaushalam policy. This initiative aims to enhance enterprise services and promote skill development in advanced technology sectors, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cybersecurity, among others. The partnerships will allow these startups to serve as Skill Solution Partners (SSPs) and Skill Development Partners (SDPs), thereby supporting BSNLs enterprise business operations.

The focus on practical training through skill development programs for students at various educational levels is particularly noteworthy. These programs will be conducted in collaboration with domain experts, ensuring that participants gain hands-on experience in next-generation technologies. As Paul William, Principal General Manager of BSNL Visakhapatnam, highlighted, these collaborations are expected to facilitate the adoption of emerging technologies across industries and support critical infrastructure upgrades.

As BSNL strengthens its role in the digital ecosystem through these partnerships, it opens up new avenues for innovation and learning. How will these initiatives shape the future of technology and skill development in India?
