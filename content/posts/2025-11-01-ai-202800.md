In a groundbreaking move, Arthrex has combined artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and cinematic storytelling to revolutionize surgical training for healthcare professionals worldwide. Their new facility, Studio X, located in Naples, Florida, is a state-of-the-art production studio that creates immersive educational content, enhancing the way surgeons learn and practice innovative techniques.

The 24,000-square-foot Studio X features advanced technologies like a massive LED screen and a Holodeck Extended Reality Stage, which allows for fully immersive training environments. This unique blend of art and science not only showcases Arthrex's commitment to innovation but also provides a platform for surgeons to gain hands-on experience after observing live procedures at the nearby Arthrex Observation Suite.
