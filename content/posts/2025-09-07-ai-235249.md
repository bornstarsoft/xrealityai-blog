Samsung Electronics is set to revolutionize its operations by embedding artificial intelligence into 90 percent of its business by 2030. This bold initiative, announced by Roh Tae-moon, the acting head of Samsungs DX Division, aims to redefine the manufacturing and marketing of everything from smartphones to home appliances. The company is positioning itself as a leader in AI integration, emphasizing that this technology will not only enhance competitiveness but also serve as a new engine for growth.

At the recent IFA 2025 trade show in Berlin, Roh highlighted the ambitious plan to install AI functions on over 400 million Galaxy devices by the end of the year. This includes expanding AI capabilities into televisions and household appliances, as well as developing robotics that utilize physical AI. With the introduction of innovative products like a tri-fold smartphone and advanced smart glasses on the horizon, Samsung is clearly committed to pushing the boundaries of technology.

As global tech companies race to embed generative AI into their offerings, Samsung's strategy to popularize AI technology across various product lines, starting with premium devices, reflects a keen understanding of market dynamics. Will Samsung's AI-driven transformation set a new standard for the tech industry, or will competitors catch up? Only time will tell.
