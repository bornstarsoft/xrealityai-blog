In a significant shift within the tech landscape, Tito Unda has stepped down as the Vice President of Product at Job&Talent to embark on a new venture centered around extended reality (XR) and artificial intelligence (AI). This move highlights the growing intersection of these technologies, which include virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). Unda's departure signals not just a personal career transition but also a broader trend where tech leaders are increasingly drawn to the innovative potential of XR and AI.

Unda's new focus on XR/AI vision comes at a time when industries are rapidly evolving to incorporate immersive technologies. As businesses seek to enhance user experiences and operational efficiencies, the demand for skilled professionals in this space is surging. With Unda's extensive background in product development, his next steps could pave the way for groundbreaking advancements in how we interact with digital environments.

As we watch this space evolve, one can't help but wonder: what new possibilities will emerge from the fusion of XR and AI? The future looks promising, and we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these technologies can achieve together.
