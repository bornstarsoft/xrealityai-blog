StretchSense, a pioneering firm in wearable technology, has recently raised $2.3 million to fuel its global expansion of XR training gloves. These innovative gloves are designed to immerse users in simulated environments, enhancing training experiences across various sectors, including healthcare, education, and defense. With nearly $20 million raised to date, StretchSense is poised to revolutionize how organizations train their staff through lifelike interactions that build muscle memory and real-world skills.

The company's newly appointed CEO, Chris Chapman, emphasizes that their gloves eliminate the need for cumbersome controllers, allowing for a more intuitive and immersive learning experience. This approach not only enhances user engagement but also promises measurable outcomes in training effectiveness. As the virtual training market is projected to reach around $265 billion by 2030, StretchSense is strategically positioned to capitalize on this growth.
