VRAcademi is set to inspire the next generation of innovators with its Future Tech Summer Camp 2025, launching in Dubai. This unique program, running from July 14 to August 29, combines cutting-edge technologies like virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and robotics with creative disciplines such as filmmaking and game design. Designed for children aged 8 to 13, the camp fosters a hands-on learning environment that encourages curiosity and creativity.

Each week of the camp focuses on different themes, from Sustainability to Space Exploration, allowing participants to engage in real-world projects that build essential skills. As Sonal Ahuja, Co-Founder of VRAcademi, emphasizes, this program is about empowering children to see the future as something they can actively shape. With a blend of technology and artistic expression, kids will not only learn but also create, culminating in a showcase of their projects at the end of each week.

As we look towards a future increasingly defined by technology, initiatives like VRAcademi's summer camp are vital in preparing young minds for the challenges and opportunities ahead. How will you encourage the next generation to explore and innovate?
