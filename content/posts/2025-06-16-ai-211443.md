Samsung is set to unveil its latest foldable smartphones, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, at the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event. One of the most exciting features of these devices is the integration of Gemini Live, a cutting-edge real-time conversational AI. This two-way multimodal AI, which supports image inputs and video content, promises to enhance user interaction and functionality, making these foldables more intuitive than ever.

In addition to AI advancements, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to feature a remarkable 200MP primary camera, bolstered by the Pro-Visual Engine for superior photo clarity and optimized video performance. These enhancements are not just about megapixels; they signify a shift towards AI-driven imaging capabilities that could redefine mobile photography. Meanwhile, the Z Flip 7 is expected to focus on improved camera output and innovative cover screen features, catering to a diverse range of user needs.

As Samsung continues to push the boundaries of technology, the durability of these devices is also under scrutiny. With a redesigned hinge structure and Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG) that promises increased toughness, users can look forward to foldables that are not only powerful but also built to last. As we anticipate the official reveal, one can't help but wonder: how will these innovations shape the future of mobile devices?
