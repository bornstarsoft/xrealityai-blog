If youre a fan of puzzle games but prefer a more relaxed experience, then Botany Manor might just be your next favorite title. Currently available for free on the Epic Games Store, this cozy first-person puzzle game invites players to step into the shoes of botanist Arabella Greene as she explores a Victorian manor to complete her botanical research. Unlike other challenging puzzle games that can leave you feeling frustrated, Botany Manor strikes a balance between engaging puzzles and a soothing atmosphere, making it perfect for casual gamers.

Lead developer Laure De May has emphasized the importance of a peaceful setting and thoughtfully designed puzzles that encourage exploration without overwhelming players. The game is designed to be approachable, allowing you to enjoy the journey of discovery rather than getting stuck on complex challenges. With positive reviews highlighting its charm and accessibility, Botany Manor is definitely worth checking out, especially since its free until February 12.

As we continue to see a rise in games that cater to casual players, its exciting to think about how titles like Botany Manor can redefine the puzzle genre. Will you be diving into this cozy adventure, or do you prefer the more intense challenges offered by games like The Witness or Myst?
