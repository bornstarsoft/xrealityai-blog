The recent announcement of a $7.5 million grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation to Cal Poly Pomona marks a significant milestone in advancing artificial intelligence applications in smart manufacturing. The establishment of the Center for Research Advancement in Smart Manufacturing (CREST-RASM) aims to equip the next generation of engineers and scientists with essential skills in robotics, digital twin technology, and cybersecurity, thereby enhancing the academic pipeline for STEM education.

Under the leadership of Professor Shokoufeh Mirzaei, CREST-RASM is set to drive transformative research that not only supports national security and sustainability but also fosters economic resilience. This initiative will not only benefit Cal Poly Pomona but also extend its impact to surrounding educational institutions, creating a collaborative environment for innovation.

As we look to the future, the integration of AI in manufacturing systems presents exciting opportunities. How will these advancements shape the landscape of engineering education and industry practices in the years to come?
