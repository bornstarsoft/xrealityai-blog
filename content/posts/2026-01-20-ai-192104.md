ASUS is making a significant pivot in its business strategy by stepping away from the smartphone market to concentrate on artificial intelligence-driven products. According to a recent report from Inside, ASUS chairman Jonney Shih announced that the company will cease launching new mobile phones and instead focus its research and development efforts on commercial PCs and innovative AI products, such as robotics systems and AI glasses. This marks a notable shift in ASUS's vision for the future of computing.

The decision to discontinue the Zenfone and ROG Phone lines reflects a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies are increasingly investing in AI technologies that promise to redefine user experiences and operational efficiencies. By reallocating resources toward AI, ASUS aims to position itself at the forefront of the next computing revolution, potentially leading to groundbreaking advancements in how we interact with technology.

As we witness this transformation, it raises an intriguing question: Could this be the beginning of a new era where AI devices take precedence over traditional smartphones? The future of tech may very well depend on how companies like ASUS adapt to these emerging trends.
