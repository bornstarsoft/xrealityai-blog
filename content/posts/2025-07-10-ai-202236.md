Samsung Electronics is set to redefine the future of mobile technology with its ambitious Project Moohan, which includes the launch of a trifold phone and an extended reality (XR) headset by the end of this year. This initiative reflects the company's commitment to diversifying device form factors in the AI era, as highlighted by Roh Tae-moon, the acting head of Samsung's Device eXperience Division. The focus is on creating innovative hardware that enhances AI experiences, making smartphones more integral to our daily lives.

As AI becomes increasingly embedded in our routines, Samsung's strategy emphasizes a shift from traditional touch-centric interactions to a more multimodal approach. The recent introduction of AI features in the Galaxy S24 and the new Galaxy Z Flip 7 showcases this evolution, with the latter featuring the advanced Exynos 2500 processor. Samsung aims to double its reach of AI capabilities to 400 million Galaxy devices this year, reinforcing its position as a leader in the tech landscape.

With competitors like Apple and various Chinese brands entering the foldable market, Samsung's early investment in this category appears to be paying off. As we look ahead, the question remains: how will these innovations shape our interaction with technology in the coming years?
