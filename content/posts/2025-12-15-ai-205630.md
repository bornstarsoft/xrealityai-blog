In a remarkable leap for digital healthcare, Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) and CelcomDigi Bhd have successfully conducted one of the world's first multi-country live surgeries utilizing 5G technology and AI-powered HoloMedicine. This pioneering event not only showcases the capabilities of advanced technology in surgical procedures but also emphasizes Malaysia's potential as a leader in medical innovation.

The live surgery, which was streamed in real-time to medical students and specialists from prestigious institutions worldwide, demonstrated how 5G connectivity can eliminate geographical barriers in medical training. Participants were able to engage in the surgical process as if they were present in the operating theatre, highlighting the transformative power of immersive technologies in education and collaboration.

As we look to the future, this initiative raises exciting questions about the role of technology in healthcare. Will we see more countries adopting similar approaches to enhance medical training and patient care? The possibilities are endless, and the implications for global healthcare could be profound.
